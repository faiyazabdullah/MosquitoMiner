# MosquitoMiner: A Light Weight Rover for Detecting and Eliminating Mosquito Breeding Sites

## Project Overview
MosquitoMiner is an innovative solution designed to autonomously detect and eliminate mosquito breeding sites, reducing the risk of mosquito-borne diseases. This project combines advanced robotics, computer vision, and machine learning to create a light-weight rover that can navigate through various terrains, identify potential breeding grounds, and apply targeted treatments to disrupt the mosquito lifecycle.
